Downstream is a free supplemental music service. It is not designed to replace existing services like Spotify or YouTube Music but to instead act as a tool to keep music you like forever. In addition it provides an excellent listening experience on desktop and we're adding features to make interacting with friends on downstream a great time.

What we're working on:
- Follow friends and see what music they collect
- Listen Together feature
- Improved music discovery
